          Hi, My name is Cameron Beiling. I'm an up and coming web developer/designer with focus on
          accessibility and aesthetics. I'm based out of Columbiana, Ohio,
          voted the nicest city in America by Reader's Digest.

              <p>
              I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. There was always something I enjoyed about the challenges that would be presented within them, and being faced with obstacles that I would have to overcome. Some games had a way of pushing me to my limits and I've always enjoyed that aspect. From that passion, I've found that a lot of the things I enjoyed about video games apply to programming as well and it quickly turned into a passion.

                I like things to be exactly as I want them to be when I'm creating
                something. Meaning that the vision you share with me with how
                you'd like your website to be designed will be met, even on the
                smallest details. I take pride in my work and put in as much effort that is needed to ensure that everything is done precisely.

              <h3 class="py-1">Tenacity</h3>
              <p>
                Once I'm faced with a problem, I can't give up until I've solved
                the problem. I don't give up on something once I have my mind set on
                it. That means, when it comes to providing you with an excellent
                service, I will always give it 100% of my effort, making sure that your website is being worked on diligently.

              <h3 class="py-1">Studious</h3>
              <p>
                I've always been analytical when it comes to problem solving.
                Making sure to factor everything into account before trying to
                come up with a solution. Making it so I'm capable of overcoming
                any obstacle I face in my work, making the work I do effective and efficient.
